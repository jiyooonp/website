<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Implementing an AR application step by step using planar homographies. Finding point correspondences between two images and use these
to estimate the homography between them. Then using this homography to warp images and finally implement it on AR applications.


### Built With: 
* Python 
* NumPy
